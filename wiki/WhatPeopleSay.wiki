    As the open data juggernaut picks up steam, a lot of folks are going to discover what some of us have known all 
    along. Much of the data that’s lying around is a mess. That’s partly because nobody has ever really looked at it. 
    As a new wave of visualization tools arrives, there will be more eyeballs on more data, and that’s a great thing. 
    But we’ll also need to be able to lay hands on the data and clean up the messes we can begin to see. 
    As we do, we’ll want to be using tools that do the kinds of things shown in the Gridworks screencasts.

    ... PowerPivot and Gridworks. Each, on its own, is an amazing tool. But the combination makes my spidey 
    sense tingle in a way I haven’t felt for a long time.

     ...the tool looks absolutely fantastic.

     This is a tremendous contribution to the community, especially given that comparable commercial products 
     are priced well out of range of small businesses, independent developers, and newsrooms. While we can’t tell 
     you about any of the projects we are using it on just yet, we can say that its changing the way we look at data 
     on a daily basis. We really can’t say enough about what a great application Gridworks is and about its myriad 
     uses for hacker journalists and data-nerds of all stripes.
