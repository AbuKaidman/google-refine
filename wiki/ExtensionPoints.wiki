#summary How extensions can hook into various points in Gridworks (1.5 or later).

This document is for the upcoming version 1.5 and later only. This is still in flux.

Extensions that come with the code base are located under [http://code.google.com/p/freebase-gridworks/source/browse/#svn/trunk/extensions the extensions subdirectory], but when you develop your own extension, you can put its code anywhere as long as you refer to that directory in [http://code.google.com/p/freebase-gridworks/source/browse/trunk/main/webapp/WEB-INF/butterfly.properties the butterfly.properites file] through a `butterfly.modules.path` setting.

=Extension File Layout=

A typical extension sits in a file directory that contains the following files and sub-directories:

{{{
  src/
      com/foo/bar/... *.java source files
  module/
      *.html, *.vt files
      scripts/... *.js files
      styles/... *.css and *.less files
      images/... image files
      MOD-INF/
          lib/*.jar files
          classes/... java class files
          module.properties
          controller.js
}}}

The file named module.properties (see [http://code.google.com/p/freebase-gridworks/source/browse/trunk/extensions/sample-extension/module/MOD-INF/module.properties example]) contains the extension's metadata. Of importance is the name field, which gives the extension a name that's used in many other places to refer to it. This can be different from the extension's directory name.

Also of importance is the dependency

{{{
  requires = core
}}}

which makes sure that the core module of Gridworks is loaded before the extension attempts to hook into it.

The file named controller.js is responsible for registering the extension's hooks into Gridworks. Look at the sample-extension extension's [http://code.google.com/p/freebase-gridworks/source/browse/trunk/extensions/sample-extension/module/MOD-INF/controller.js controller.js] file for an example. It should have a function called init() that does the hook registrations.


=Javascript and CSS=

The UI in Gridworks for working with a project is coded in [http://code.google.com/p/freebase-gridworks/source/browse/trunk/main/webapp/modules/core/project.vt this file]. The file is quite small, and that's because almost all of its content is to be expanded dynamically through the Velocity variables $scriptInjection and $styleInjection.
