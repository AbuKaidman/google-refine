#summary How extensions can hook into various points in Gridworks (1.5 or later).

This document is for the upcoming version 1.5 and later only.

=Extension File Layout=

A typical extension sits under the extensions directory and has this layout:

{{{
  extensions/
    [extension-name]/
      module/
        scripts/
        styles/
        images/
        MOD-INF/
          lib/
          classes/
          module.properties
          controller.js
}}}

The file named module.properties (see [http://code.google.com/p/freebase-gridworks/source/browse/trunk/extensions/sample-extension/module/MOD-INF/module.properties example]) contains the extension's metadata. Of importance is the name field, which gives the extension a name that's used in many other places to refer to it. Also of importance is the dependency

{{{  requires = more}}}

which makes sure that the core module of Gridworks is loaded before the extension attempts to hook into it.

The file named controller.js is responsible for registering the extension's hooks into Gridworks. Look at the sample-extension extension's [http://code.google.com/p/freebase-gridworks/source/browse/trunk/extensions/sample-extension/module/MOD-INF/controller.js controller.js] file for an example.

{{{
  function init() {
    ...
  }
}}}
