#summary How extensions can hook into various points in Gridworks (1.5 or later).

This document is for the upcoming version 1.5 and later only.

=Extension File Layout=

A typical extension sits under the extensions directory and has this layout:

{{{
  extensions/
    [extension-name]/
      module/
        scripts/
        styles/
        images/
        MOD-INF/
          lib/
          classes/
          controller.js
}}}

The file named controller.js is responsible for registering the extension's hooks into Gridworks.

{{{
  function init() {
    ...
  }
}}}
