#summary Planning for 1.5 release

==Must-haves for 1.5==

  * Allow extensions to be disabled (need butterfly support) - stefanom?
  * Refactoring probably leaves distribution ant targets not working - make sure they work again
  * Support for QA context in data loads (in progress) - dfhuynh
    * Schema skeleton must allow some links to be marked as not for loading (but just for context)
 
==Nice-to-have==

Can be in 1.5.1 release.

Easy

  * Issue 29: Delievered "Collapse whitespace" transformation does not work
  * Issue 74: Saveable Templates
  * Issue 75: Saveable reconciliation mappings
  * Issue 86: Parse cells after splitting columns

Medium

  * Issue 36:	[Wishlist] Seamless conversion of arrays into multiple columns
    * which will solve Issue 37: [Wishlist] match() function to turn results of regexp groups into an array

==Probably 1.6==

  * Views: map, timeline, protovis charts

  * Issue 40: Facet by date - hard design
  * Issue 82: Add Pivot function to GEL - could be tricky implementation
  * Issue 84: Add a cut and paste textbox importer ? - mostly design work
  * Issue 85: Fixed width column importer - seems easy
  * Issue 87: Long running processes should serialize intermediate results ? - hard (dfhuynh)
  * Issue 92: Add Columns From Freebase dialog should support constraints - design work
  * Issue 97: Exporting CSV should allow for optional columns
