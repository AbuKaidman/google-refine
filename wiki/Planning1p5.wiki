#summary Planning for 1.5 release

==Must-haves for 1.5==

  * Support for QA context in data loads (in progress) - dfhuynh
    * Schema skeleton must allow some links to be marked as not for loading (but just for context)
  * Support for users to add extensions to their own installations of Gridworks - stefanom
  * More documentation and testing on the standard reconciliation service stuff - dfhuynh
  * Performance - the /project page seems to be slow now

Can be in 1.5.1 release.

Easy

  * Issue 74: Saveable Templates

==1.6==

   * Issue 84: Add a cut and paste textbox importer ? - mostly design work

  * Issue 87: Long running processes should serialize intermediate results ? - hard (dfhuynh)
  * Issue 92: Add Columns From Freebase dialog should support constraints - design work
