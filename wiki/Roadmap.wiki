===Introduction===

Gridworks is a tool for [Dataparsing parsing], [Datafiltering filtering] and [Datamining mining] data.  It also provides reconciliation and augmentation of data.

Gridworks has a few key features which should be maintained in any future development.
  * *data comes first* and structure is added to it later.
  * Gridworks doesn't impose or enforce *any type of workflow*
  * Gridworks *intelligently determines* the data type and encoding
  * full and *persistent undo/redo*
  * subsets of data accessed through *faceted browsing*
  * *Extensible* modular [PluginInterfaces plugin] architecture
  * *Data augmentation and reconciliation* from multiple external sources

== 1.5==

  * Support for QA context in data loads (in progress) - dfhuynh
    * Schema skeleton must allow some links to be marked as not for loading (but just for context)
  * Support for users to add extensions to their own installations of Gridworks - stefanom
  * More documentation and testing on the standard reconciliation service stuff - dfhuynh
  * Performance - the /project page seems to be slow now

==1.5.1==

  * Issue 36: Seamless conversion of arrays into multiple columns
  * Issue 74: Saveable Templates
  * Issue 75: Saveable reconciliation mappings
  * Issue 86: Parse cells after splitting columns

==1.6==

  * Issue 84: Add a cut and paste textbox importer ? - mostly design work
  * Issue 85: Fixed width column importer - seems easy
  * Issue 87: Long running processes should serialize intermediate results ? - hard (dfhuynh)
  * Issue 92: Add Columns From Freebase dialog should support constraints - design work
  * Issue 97: Exporting CSV should allow for optional columns

==1.7==

  * Views: map, timeline, protovis charts
 
==2.0==

  * Issue 83: JSON importer
  * Issue 84: Textbox importer
  * Issue 86: parse cell values after column split
  * Issue 88: when applying operations, try to fix common json errors, like missing or extraneous commas and missing top level brackets. This is probably important for inexperienced (aka non-programming) users.
  * Issue 97: TSV/CSV exporter should allow option on which columns to export
  * Issue 98: optional regexp parsing at import
  * Issue 101: (Broker) Collaborative editing support 

==2.x==

  * Issue 68: "merge columns" command.
  * Issue 89: ability to move columns
  * Better machinery to guess and re-encode cell values (useful for fixing encoding issues)
  * Issue 91: option or preference to only show Freebase /common types in dropdowns for type and property suggestions.
  * Issue 92: extend data dialog box should support constraints
  * Issue 93: Display column groups
  * Issue 94: map facet

==3.0==
  * Issue 85: graphical manipulation of widths of fixed-width column data
  * Issue 87: long running processes should serialize their intermediate results and recover later, too.
  * Issue 90: ability to cluster records -- to look for records that look alike and might actually be the same (useful for de-duplication)
  * Issue 96: Data set joins - this is quite compelling but needs more architectural thinking
  * RABJ integration (build a queue with

====miscellaneous====
Are the below still required?  (Please create a [http://code.google.com/p/freebase-gridworks/issues/entry new issue report] if so)

  * after splitting multi-valued cells, you can't filter by the context columns anymore, e.g., filter film director by from original country
  * After splitting a row, doing a custom transform where you refer to another column seems to only apply to the first row
  ** This requires adding a "context" variable to the evaluation environment. "context[column name]" would return the context cell in column "column name".
