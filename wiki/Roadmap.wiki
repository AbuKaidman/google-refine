#summary Gridworks Roadmap

===Introduction===

<img src="http://freebase-gridworks.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/BenFry-CID-2004-process.png" width="400" align="right" alt="Process of Computational Information Design - copyright Ben Fry 2004" />
Gridworks is a tool for [Dataparsing parsing], [Datafiltering filtering] and [Datamining mining] data.

Gridworks has a few key features which should be maintained in any future development.
  * *data comes first* and structure is added to it later.
  * Gridworks doesn't impose or enforce *any type of workflow*
  * full and *persistent undo/redo*
  * subsets of data accessed through *faceted browsing*
  * *Extensible* modular [PluginInterfaces plugin] architecture
  * *Data augmentation and reconciliation* from multiple external sources

===Planned Features ===

  * Issue 83: JSON importer
  * Issue 84: Textbox importer
  * Issue 85: graphical manipulation of widths of fixed-width column data
  * Issue 98: optional regexp parsing at import
  * Better machinery to guess and re-encode cell values (useful for fixing encoding issues)

  * Issue 97: TSV/CSV exporter should allow option on which columns to export

  * Issue 96: Data set joins - this is quite compelling but needs more architectural thinking
  * Issue 68: "merge columns" command.
  * Issue 86: parse cell values after column split
  * Issue 87: long running processes should serialize their intermediate results and recover later, too.

  * RABJ integration
  * Issue 90: ability to cluster records -- to look for records that look alike and might actually be the same (useful for de-duplication)

  * Issue 92: extend data dialog box should support constraints
  * Issue 91: option or preference to only show Freebase /common types in dropdowns for type and property suggestions.

  * Issue 89: ability to move columns
  * Issue 93: Display column groups
  * Issue 94: map facet
  * Issue 95: timeline facet

  * Issue 88: when applying operations, try to fix common json errors, like missing or extraneous commas and missing top level brackets. This is probably important for inexperienced (aka non-programming) users.


==Feature Requests, Bugs, Comments, Etc.==

Please go to the [http://code.google.com/p/freebase-gridworks/issues/list issues tracker] for the most up to-date list.

====miscellaneous====
Are the below still required?  (Please create a [http://code.google.com/p/freebase-gridworks/issues/entry new issue report] if so)

  * after splitting multi-valued cells, you can't filter by the context columns anymore, e.g., filter film director by from original country
  * After splitting a row, doing a custom transform where you refer to another column seems to only apply to the first row
  ** This requires adding a "context" variable to the evaluation environment. "context[column name]" would return the context cell in column "column name".
