#summary Frequently Asked Questions

This is a collection of frequently asked questions on Gridworks. Feel free to add your own question to the comments, we'll try to answer to the best of our abilities and add them to this list.

== Where is the Data Stored? ==

All your projects are stored on your own computer:

MacOSX:
  * ~/Library/Application Support/Gridworks/

Windows: depending on the Windows version, the data is in one of these directories
  * C:\Documents and Settings\(user id)\Local Settings\Application Data\Gridworks
  * C:\Users\(user id)\AppData\Roaming\Gridworks
  * C:\Users\(user id)\Gridworks

Linux:
  * ~/.local/share/gridworks/

== I get java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space errors, ==
== or it feels SLOW - How do I expand the memory that Gridworks can use? ==

Since Gridworks is a Java application that utilizes the JVM, you might need to allocate enough memory to handle processing large files and avoid java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space errors.  But, you will also need to balance that allocation with the needs of your OS to prevent disk caching problems.

A typical best practice is to start with no more than 50% of your available physical memory, since certain OS's will utilize up to 1 Gig or more of physical RAM.

Example: If you have 2 Gigs of memory and run Windows Vista or 7, you might only have 1 gig of physical memory left over.  Starting with a setting of 512m (50% of 1 Gig) can avoid disk caching problems processing large files with many rows and columns. (A 200 meg text file of 331,000 rows x 50 columns)

=== Windows ===

Open a "command prompt", 'cd' to the folder where Gridworks is installed, then type

  gridworks \m 2048m

where "2048m" is the maximum amount of memory (in Mb) that you want Gridworks to use.

=== Mac ===

If you have downloaded the ".dmg" package and you start Gridworks by double clicking on it, follow these instructions

  * close gridworks
  * "control-click" on the gridworks icon (opens the contextual menu)
  * click on "show package content" (a finder window opens)
  * open the "Contents" folder
  * double click on the "Info.plist" file (a Property List Editor app comes up)
  * expand the "java" section at the bottom
  * double click on the "VMOptions" content (the right end side)
  * change "${java.options}" with "-Xms256M -Xmx1024M"
  * save file
  * start gridworks again

=== Linux (or Mac) ===

If you have downloaded the ".tar.gz" package and you start Gridworks from the command line, use the "-m xxxM" parameter like this

   ./gridworks -m 1024m

== What syntax of regular expression (regex) does Gridworks support ? ==

The regular expression syntax is that of Java regex, not of Javascript.

http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/essential/regex/index.html

^ and $ should also work in the regex mode.

Note that the Gridworks expression language (GEL) also supports regex, e.g.,

Example to replace "Rd" abbreviation with "Road".

    value.replace(/\brd\b/i, "Road")

It should also handle "capture groups".
