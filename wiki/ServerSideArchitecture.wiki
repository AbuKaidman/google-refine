#summary Server-side architecture.

Gridworks' server-side is written entirely in Java (`src/main/java/`) and its entry point is the Java servlet `com.metaweb.gridworks.GridworksServlet`. By default, the servlet is hosted in the lightweight Jetty web server instantiated by `src/server/java/com.metaweb.gridworks.Gridworks`. Note that the server class itself is under `src\server\`, not `src\main\`; this separation leaves the possibility of hosting `GridworksServlet` in a different servlet container.

The web server configuration is in `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml`; that's where `GridworksServlet` is hooked up. `GridworksServlet` itself is simple: it just reacts to requests from the client-side by routing them to the right `Command` class in the packages `com.metaweb.gridworks.commands.*`.

As mentioned before, the server-side maintains states of the data, and the primary class involved is `com.metaweb.gridworks.ProjectManager`.
