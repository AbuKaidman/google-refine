Gridworks testing is at the very early stages but we've tried to create a working skeleton that we can fill up later collaboratively with the open source project rather than doing a full-blown QA coverage.

Since Gridworks is composed of two parts, a server and a in-browser UI, the testing system reflects that:

* on the server side, it's powered by JUnit and the unit tests are written in Java
* on the client side, it's powered by Windmill and the unit tests are written in Javascript

To run the testing framework, simply type

   ./gridworks test

from the command line (sorry, this works only on unix systems... it might work on cygwin under windows but we have not tested that yet).

The above command requires you to have a "python" and "curl" installed on your machine (which you probably already do).

if you want to run only the server side portion of the tests run

   ./gridworks server_test

or, if you want to run only the client side portion of the tests run

   ./gridworks ui_test

By default, the ui_test action will execute Windmill and close it once all the tests have been run. If you want to leave it open to use the Windmill IDE to prototype new tests, you can run Windmill interactively like this

    ./gridworks ui_test interactive
